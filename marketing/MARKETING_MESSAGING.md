> **Strategic Source:** This document is derived from `docs/JTBD_SUMMARY.md`. Refer to that file for the deep "Jobs to be Done" analysis.

## 1. Core Positioning

**BarracudaSEO is the decision-support layer for technical SEO audits.**

It helps technical SEOs and agencies **decide what actually matters** in a site audit — and gives them the **confidence to explain why**.

### What we are NOT:
* ❌ Another generic "SEO audit tool"
* ❌ A "Screaming Frog alternative" (we are complimentary, not just a replacement)
* ❌ A "Magic AI box" (we are transparent/opinionated)

---

## 2. The Golden Circle (Why / How / What)

*   **WHY**: To reduce the cognitive load and anxiety of technical audits.
*   **HOW**: By being opinionated by design—filtering out noise and surfacing only the issues that impact revenue and visibility.
*   **WHAT**: A web-based crawler and decision engine that prioritizes fixes and explains the *rationale* behind them.

## 3. Key Messaging Pillars

### Pillar 1: Clarity over Chaos
*   **Pain**: Drowning in spreadsheets, 10,000 "info" warnings, analysis paralysis.
*   **Promise**: "You don't need more data. You need to know what matters."
*   **Proof**: Prioritized Issue Scoring, "Why this matters" panels.

### Pillar 2: Confidence & Defensibility
*   **Pain**: Fear of recommending the wrong fix; inability to explain technical issues to clients.
*   **Promise**: "Walk into client calls confident and prepared."
*   **Proof**: Explanatory AI recommendations, Transparent logic (not a black box).

### Pillar 3: Efficiency for Experts
*   **Pain**: Wasting hours configuring crawls and merging CSVs.
*   **Promise**: "Stop collecting issues. Start fixing them."
*   **Proof**: Zero-config cloud crawling, CLI for automation, Team collaboration.
